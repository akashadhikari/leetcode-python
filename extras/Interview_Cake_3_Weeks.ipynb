    "\n",
    "To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as a tuple ↴ of integers `(start_time, end_time)`. These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.\n",

But we want the function to work even for very large numbers, like Unix timestamps. In any case, the spirit of the challenge is to merge meetings where start_time and end_time don't have an upper bound."
